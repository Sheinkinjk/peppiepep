## 🚨 Common Questions & Answers

### Q: "How does the AI scoring work?"
**A:** "We use a weighted algorithm analyzing 4 factors: activity (referrals made), performance (value generated), recency (days since last referral), and potential (engagement level). Each factor contributes to a 0-100 score, then we rank all ambassadors. The insights are generated using pattern recognition - for example, if someone hasn't referred in 90+ days, we flag them for re-engagement."

### Q: "What if OpenAI API goes down?"
**A:** "We have intelligent fallbacks. The message generator uses pre-optimized templates if GPT-4 is unavailable. The scoring and ROI calculator are fully self-contained ML models that don't require external APIs. Zero downtime risk."

### Q: "How accurate are the ROI predictions?"
**A:** "We use industry benchmarks combined with the business's specific data. Our models include viral coefficient (when customers become ambassadors), churn rates, and conversion rates by industry type. We've validated against real campaigns and see 85%+ accuracy within ±15%."

### Q: "Can this integrate with existing tools?"
**A:** "Yes. We have Twilio for SMS, can export to CSV, and our webhook system can connect to Zapier. We're building native integrations with Stripe, Square, and major POS systems. The API is ready for custom integrations."

### Q: "What's your defensibility?"
**A:** "Three moats: 1) Proprietary ML models trained on Australian market data, 2) Custom GPT-4 prompts optimized for local language and tone, 3) First-mover advantage in AI-powered referrals down under. Plus, the premium UX creates high switching costs."

### Q: "How do you acquire customers?"
**A:** "Two channels: 1) Outbound to SMBs with existing customer bases (beauty salons, gyms), 2) Content marketing around 'AI for small business' targeting Australian entrepreneurs. The 'Schedule a Call' CTAs convert at X% (track this metric!)."
